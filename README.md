# Notebook

This is a simple Markdown notebook, which has math expression support.

I made it for two purposes:
* I wanted to re-learn ReactJS (since I've forgotten, from not using it)
* I couldn't find any alternatives, that supported math expressions.

## Usage

**Download modules:**

    npm install

**Run as development server:**

    npm start

This will start a server on port 3000, on localhost.
